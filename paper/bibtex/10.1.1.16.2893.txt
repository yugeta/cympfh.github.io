  abstract={Nowadays most audio content identification systems are based on
watermarking technology. In this paper we present a different
technology, referred to as robust audio hashing. By extracting robust
features and translating them into a bit string, we get an object
called a robust hash. Content can then be identified by comparing hash
values of a received audio clip with the hash values of previously
stored original audio clips. A distinguishing feature of the proposed
hash scheme is its ability to extract a bit string for every so many
milliseconds. More precisely, for every windowed time interval a hash
value of 32 bits is computed by thresholding energy differences of
several frequency bands. A sequence of 256 hash values, corresponding
to approximately 3 seconds of audio, can uniquely identify a song.
Experimental results show that the proposed scheme is robust against
severe compression, but bit errors do occur. This implies that
searching and matching is a non-trivial task for large databases. For
instance, a brute force search approach is already prohibitive for
databases containing hash values of more than 100 songs. Therefore we
propose a scheme that exploits a structured search algorithm that
allows searching databases containing over 100,000 songs.  1},
