  abstract={We introduce a novel amortization technique for computation of
consecutive preimages of hash chains, given knowledge of the seed.
While all previously known techniques have a memory-times-
computational complexity of O(n) per chain element, the complexity of
our technique can be upper bounded at O(log 2 n), making it a useful
primitive for low-cost applications such as authentication, signatures
and micro-payments. Our technique uses a logarithmic number of pebbles
associated with points on the hash chain. The locations of these
pebbles are modified over time. Like fractals, where images can be
found within images, the pebbles move within intervals and sub-
intervals according to a highly symmetric pattern. Keywords:
amortization, authentication, hash chain, smart dust.  1},
