  abstract={in the same sentence. Consider, for instance, the sentence "Despite
the pretty design I would never recommend it, because the sound
quality is unacceptable" which expresses both positive and negative
opinions about a product. Thus, to determine both negative and
positive utterances in product reviews, classification on the
subsentence level is needed.  Sentiment analysis is the problem of
determining the polarity of a text with respect to a particular topic.
For most applications, however, it is not only necessary to derive the
polarity of a text as a whole but also to extract negative and
positive utterances on a more finegrained level. Sentiment analysis
systems working on the (sub-)sentence level, however, are difficult to
develop since shorter textual segments rarely carry enough information
to determine their polarity out of context. In this paper, therefore,
we present a fully automatic framework for fine-grained sentiment
analysis on the subsentence level combining multiple sentiment
lexicons and neighborhood as well as discourse relations to overcome
this problem. [abriged]},
