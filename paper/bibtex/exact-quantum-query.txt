  abstract={A quantum algorithm is exact if it always produces the correct answer,
on any input. Coming up with exact quantum algorithms that
substantially outperform the best classical algorithm has been a quite
challenging task. In this paper, we present two new exact quantum
algorithms for natural problems: o for the problem EXACTn in which we
have to determine whether the k sequence of input bits x1 , . . . , xn
contains exactly k values xi = 1; o for the problem THRESHOLDn in
which we have to determine if at k least k of n input bits are equal
to 1.  1},
